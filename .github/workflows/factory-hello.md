# Factory hello

Issue number: ${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}. Run id: ${{ github.run_id }}.

Do exactly two things on that issue and nothing else.

1. Add one comment with the text `hello from the factory, run ${{ github.run_id }}`.
2. Add the label `factory:hello`.

Do not read other issues, do not edit files, and do not comment anywhere else.
